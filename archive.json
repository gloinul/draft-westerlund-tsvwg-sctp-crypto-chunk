Such case would possibly happen when protection engine has internal data to be sent and the Upper Layer Application has no traffic for a long time.\r\nAlternative is complex and requires a though interaction between protection engine and SCTP, it may be that in case of SCTP is idle then protection engine forces HB chunks to be sent. \r\nA simpler solution is to tune HB properly, for instance by sending an HB every 2 seconds or so. This we can provide as recommendation for the specific protection engine. In DTLS I'd see a good choice to have HB at 2 seconds rate. ",

To my understanding if one supports ASCONF and CRYPTO what will happen is that the arriving packet with the ASCONF chunk will first be looked up based on VTAG, then have the protection operation being run on it.

Noted that meta data about the arriving packet's source IP address may be required when the Address field in the ASCONF is null. And the Address field can't be used to locate the association context. Thus SCTP stacks with CRYPTO chunk support will have to use the VTAG + arrival port as the method for finding the right association and can't rely on source IP, which anyway ASCONF in some usages can't do either.
